## 🧠 Business Context

AtliQ Industries needed a central BI solution to monitor the performance of different departments, track year-over-year growth, identify gaps vs. targets, and highlight areas of operational improvement.

As a **Data Analyst**, I took the role of transforming scattered datasets into a unified Power BI solution with deep financial and operational KPIs.
